# Global Data Science Trends: Analysis of Professional Survey
This project involved analyzing survey data of data professionals to understand trends in salaries, education levels, programming languages, job roles, and other factors. The raw data was cleaned and modeled in Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for visualization.
## Data
The dataset contains survey responses from over 3000 data professionals worldwide. It includes information on:
-	Country of residence
-	Gender
-	Highest education level
-	Programming languages known
-	Primary job role
-	Perceived difficulty of data science
-	Salary
-	Work life balance rating
-	Happiness with salary
## Data Cleaning
The raw data needed some preprocessing before analysis. The major data cleaning steps included:
-	Handling missing values
-	Fixing inconsistent categorical values
-	Parsing numeric fields from salaries
-	Converting currencies to a common unit
## Data Modeling
The cleaned survey table was modeled with appropriate data types and relationships in Power BI for easier aggregation and analysis. Additional tables were created for geo/location data and data on programming languages.
## Dashboard & Visualizations
An interactive Power BI dashboard was designed with various visualizations to provide insights into:
-	Salary ranges by country, role, and experience levels
-	Most common programming languages among roles
-	Difficulty rating depending on the experience with data science
-	Comparing work happiness by gender and salary
-	Percentage of roles by country and gender
The final dashboard allows slicing data across multiple dimensions to derive customized insights.
## Usage
